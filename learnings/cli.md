# Running a C# code

To work with a C# code we need two tools 
- a compiler (To compile the C# code into a Intermediate language [IL] by generating .dll files and .exe files)
- a runtime (To convert the IL it into machine code and run the code itself)

By default these are a part of the `.NET framework (Only for Windows)`/`.NET Core(Cross env)`

[For a more simpler explaination refer here](https://codeasy.net/lesson/c_sharp_compilation_process)

## Compilation
To compile a C# program we first need to install the `.NET Core/Framework` depending upon the environment you have. 
Post that we can start compiling a C# program by either running `dotnet build` or `csc`.
